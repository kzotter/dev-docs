Esper creates a better development experience for integrating management for your apps and device fleet, and is designed for the entire development lifecycle. A [rich API](https://api.esper.io) set and a variety of [open-source SDKs](https://github.com/esper-io/esper-client-py) and tools lets you live in the environments that best suite your productivity - such as Android Studio, via CLI, or IDLE.\
