# Requirements
In order to use the Esper tools, the following are the minimum requirements covering the different tools.

## Web-Based Esper Console Requirements
The Esper Console requires Chrome v57+.

## Device Requirements
Targeted Dedicated Devices must run Android version 4.4 KitKat (API Level 19) or above. Alternatively, Esper Development Devices running Esper Enhanced Android can be used; this opens up additional features when using Esper.

## Esper Tools Requirements
To use the Esper SDK for Python or the Esper CLI you need to have Python 3.6+ installed. While you can use Python 2.7 with the Esper SDK for Python, we recommend using 3.6+ so you can also use the Esper CLI. You can install the required Python version for your platform from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

#### Esper SDK Language Support
- Python

> Note: Esper plans to release SDK support for Kotlin, Java, and JavaScript. If you are using a language other than Python and would like to immediately work with the Esper APIs, please consider calling the APIs directly. You can refer to the Esper API documentation [here](./api.md).

#### Supported Development Platforms: 
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows


If you face any issues setting up your requirements for Esper, please  reach out to Esper [Support](./support.md)
